### Hi there 👋, I'm Douglas

I love videogames 🎮, metal 🤘, cats 🐈‍⬛ and building stuff 🏗.

My first line of code was written in Ruby using RPG Maker XP and since then I'm in love with software development.
I journeyed through Ruby, DarkBasic, C++(College), Java (First Job) and then to Ruby on Rails.
In the middle of all that I learned a lot of stuff, mainly web development tec and SQL.
