### Hi there 👋, I'm Douglas

I love videogames 🎮, metal 🤘, classic music 🎻 and building stuff 🏗.

My first line of code was written in Ruby using RPG Maker XP and since then I'm in love with software development.
I journeyed from Ruby, to DarkBasic, to C++(College), to Java (First Job), to Ruby on Rails, back to Java and finaly back to Rails again.
In the middle of all that I learned a lot of stuff, mainly web development tec and SQL.

I'm currently learning React and TDD with Rails.
